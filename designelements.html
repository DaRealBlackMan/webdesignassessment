        <h2>Shape</h2>
        
        
        
        <br>
        <p>This is the basic shape of a helmet. The helmet was originally made from a square mesh. The square mesh was subdivided into three cuts. After subdividing the mesh I cut it in half to get the bowl-like shape of a helmet. Once making the bowl-like shape I used the extrude option to extend and create some faces to make the padded neck cover and the ear pads/muffs of the helmet. My original plan for the helmet was to make it look like a racing helmet, so I decided to make the helmet have a neck pad/cover and ear pads to give it a racing kind of look. I made the ear pads stick out to show the general position of a racer's ears so it would look more realistic. The neck and ear pads are lower down the helmet compared to the front of the helmet that 
        <br>
        covers the forehead because the neck and ears are lower than the forehead and I modelled the
        <br>    
        helmet like this to make it look genuine.</p>

            <h2>Texture</h2>
        
            <p>When I made the basic shape of the helmet I planned on making the texture of it smooth to make it look brand new and shiny/reflective. The helmet started out as a default square mesh which I subdivided and smoothed  into three cuts, making it more detailed, smooth and precise. After I made the neck and ear pads I smoothed them out to make the shape more round resulting in the helmet looking glossy compared to it looking ragged and bulky if it wasn't smooth. </p>

    <div id='designcolour'>
        <h2>Colour</h2>
        <br>
        
        <p>I chose a greyish-black colour as the vital colour of the helmet as it makes the helmet look shiny, crisp and simple. There is a red line on top of the helmet running down the middle of it, making a design. It also makes the helmet look more attractive and eye-catching. The greyish-black shows power and mystery and the red adds to it as it is appealing and it is an accent colour, contrasting well with black.</p>
